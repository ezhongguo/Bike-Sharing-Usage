## Predictive Modeling for Bike-Sharing Usage
**Description:**
The project focuses on building predictive models to forecast pick-up and drop-off counts at bike-sharing stations. Utilizing historical data on weather conditions and bike-sharing usage, linear regression models were developed to provide insights into the optimal allocation of bikes and docks at specific stations. 

**Skills:**
Data Analysis and Preprocessing
Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning
Python Programming (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Understanding of Linear Regression and Model Evaluation Metrics
Domain Knowledge in Bike-Sharing Operations and Weather Impact

**Roles:**
Responsible for data preprocessing, feature selection, model development, and evaluation.

**Team Size:** 4

**Project Workflow:**
* Data Collection: Gather historical data on bike-sharing usage, weather conditions, and station details.
* Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and create new features.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and visualize the data to understand patterns, correlations, and trends.
* Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that impact bike-sharing usage based on EDA and correlation analysis.
* Model Development: Build linear regression models to predict pick-up and drop-off counts using selected features.
* Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and other relevant metrics.
* Optimal Allocation Recommendations: Utilize the models to suggest the optimal number of bikes and docks for specific stations.
* Implementation & Monitoring: Implement the recommendations and continuously monitor the system's performance to make necessary adjustments.
